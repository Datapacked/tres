# tres
tres because uno was taken

Also I have not made a client for this, the best way to play with the server is to use IRC, also everything is in plaintext sadly, I should probably implement separate channels at some point lol

## How to run

Install and configure `inspircd` to run on port `6667`

Run `server.js`

Cards are configured and read from `cards.xml` and transpiled into JSON for easier accessing and reading and parsing

Make sure to remove `cards.json` after modifying `cards.xml`

Client TBD but once it works, point it to the IRC server and channel the `tres` server is connected to

the commands are self-explanatory in `server.js`

Make a client lmao
